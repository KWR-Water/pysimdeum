# pySIMDEUM
Repository to share demand generator Python software with Mirjam Blokker and KWR

Uses Python 3.x

Used Python packages:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `xarray`
* `traits` (for strict type definitions of classes, could be replaced by Python's type annotations)
* `toml`


It is recommended to install Python Anaconda distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

All packages can be installed either with `conda install <packagename>` or `pip install <packagename>` in a terminal. 
(Actually, `toml` is the only package that has to be installed with `pip`)

The Python script `sim_water_use.py` shows how the pySIMDEUM can be used.
